# OTP-to-email-or-cellphone
Script to send otp to email or cellphone .

pip install twilio

Remember to replace the placeholder values (e.g., SMTP server, Twilio credentials) with your actual information. This script generates an OTP, sends it via email and SMS, and verifies the entered OTP against the generated one. It demonstrates the basic concept of sending OTPs through these channels, but in a production environment, you should consider additional security measures and error handling.
